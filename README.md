### 👋 Hi there, I’m **Diana** - Backend-leaning **Full-Stack Engineer** (Node.js, React, AWS) 5+ yrs

<!--
**noirkotyara/noirkotyara** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

- 🚢 I ship end-to-end: requirements → design → testing → release → monitoring  
- ✍️ I make trade-offs explicit, write concise docs, and plan releases clearly  
- 🧪 I own quality & production health and help teammates via reviews/pairing

**🧰 Core stack:** TypeScript • Node.js (Express/Nest) • React • SQL (MySQL/PostgreSQL) • AWS  
**🏷️ Domains:** HealthTech • MediaTech • FinTech  
**🧭 Work style:** responsible, detail-oriented, fast after deliberate planning; team player, open & sincere

#### 🎯 Focus
- Clean, observable APIs • data modeling & query performance • pragmatic testing  
- Scalability: caching, rate-limits, background jobs, idempotent integrations

#### 📚 Growth track (at a glance)
| ✅ Recently sharpened | 🔭 Currently deepening |
| --- | --- |
| Generative AI in Node.js with LangChain (structured outputs, tool use, evals), OpenSearch basics | Practical Solution Architecture (trade-off frameworks, runbooks, SLOs), **NestJS microservices** (message patterns, RMQ/NATS transports, orchestration), Go (goroutines/channels, interfaces), Elasticsearch (indexing, analyzers, query DSL) |

> 🎯 Targeting **backend-focused** roles (Node/Go) — **also open to full-stack** positions and **proficient in React**.
