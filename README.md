### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a full-stack engineer with 5+ years of experience building web apps with Node.js, TypeScript, React, MySQL and AWS. Turning messy ideas into clean, scalable solutions is my thing â€” front to back, but especially on the backend.

I value simplicity, focus, and doing less but better â€” whether in code or in life. 

Discipline keeps me sharp â€” quiet routines keep me sane.

Always curious and love picking up new tools when they feel interesting. Lately messing around with Go just to see what it brings to the table.
